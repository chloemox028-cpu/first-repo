    <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>    
    <h2>DC heroes</h2>
    <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em> <br> 
        The storylines are more complex, and <u> address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong> Green Arrow.</strong></p>
    
    <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
    <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more two demensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industies, wheras DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industies are more mediocre</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>    
    <p>But they do have decent movies and Tv shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
    <blockquote>To sumarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
